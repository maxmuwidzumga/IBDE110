    <p>We can assist with landscaping projects of all shapes and sizes. As our client, you will have access to our pre-made landscaping plans and environmental design software to refine your landscaping plans. All these tools are available at our Vernacular Architecture and Landscape Architecture Department.</p>

    <p>While we specialize in Zen garden designs, we also have staff members who are experts in general garden design, including contemporary public parks, home front garden design, waterfront gardens, streets, and walkways. A 30-minute consultation can make a huge difference in refining your landscape design and planning success strategies. Best of all, the first 30-minute consultation is FREE.</p>
